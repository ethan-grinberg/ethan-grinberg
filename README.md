### Hi there 👋😵‍

As an undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Illinois, I've developed a passion for full stack development. Creating tools that make peoples' lives better excites me and hopefully I can make a living doing so. 

I'm comfortable with a variety of technologies including: Python, Java, C++, Javascript, C, Flask, Vue.js, React.js, Docker, AWS S3, Git, Linux, Pytest, Catch2, Pandas, Numpy, Networkx, Sklearn, Selenium, BS4, Altair, Matplotlib, Spacy, NLTK, TensorFlow, RLlib

Outside of coding hunched over at my desk, I enjoy watching nature documentaries, playing chess, and learning new ideas (anything from biology to psychology to economics).
