# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a software engineer, I work hard at being lazy. In other words, I'll spend hours coding so I never have to write a shopping list again. Give me a project that has the ability to make someone's life better and I won't be able to stop thinking about it until it's perfect. 

Vue.js, Node.js, Python, and PostgreSQL is my go-to tech stack, but I'm open to quickly adapting to any tech stack needed to bring an idea to life. 

Outside of automating everything, I enjoy chess, soccer, and videos of Orangutans driving golf carts.
